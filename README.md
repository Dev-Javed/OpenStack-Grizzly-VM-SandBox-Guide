OpenStack-Grizzly-VM-SandBox-Guide
==================================

This is a guide for Stackers who want to have a more simpler, step by step process to deploy OpenStack Grizzly using Virtual Machines.

I will not be putting up the same thing for VMware, if you still want this fell free to drop an email: pps.pranav@gmail.com

Note: This guide is in progress and is not adviced to be reffered to until you really know what you are doing.
